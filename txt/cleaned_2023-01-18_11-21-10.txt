i would always question when guys in a relationship would say "i'm not interested in any other girls now"

ðŸ§¢ðŸ§¢ðŸ§¢ i thought

but now ... i feel it

there was a pretty girl on the subway today and normally i'd feel compelled to say hi, introduce myself, but instead i felt nothing

i simply thought, "she's no anna, that's for sure"

and, no, this ofc doesn't mean my eyes don't work anymore. i can still recognize when someone's attractive. but i no longer have a need to try and get to know them.
