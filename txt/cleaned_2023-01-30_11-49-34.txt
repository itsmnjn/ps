we said "i love you" to each other for the first time this past weekend

and this morning when i woke up, you called me "my love"

i played you that voice memo i recorded on jan 13th, two days after our first facetime call

i really poured my heart out didn't i

and you couldn't have accepted my love any better than you did

you couldn't have reciprocated any better than you did

you couldn't have validated my feelings any better than you did

i love you, anna, and i am the happiest boy alive to be able to say that to you now, freely, without any inhibition
