i really thought a lot about us the past few days

to say you’ve been on my mind would be an understatement. you’ve been ever-present.

i wonder if i’ve been on your mind too. i hope i have. i mean, you’ve been sending me ig reels, and pics of ur food, and you even sent me spotify’s new developer docs. 

but you haven’t been saying much.

your responses have been kinda short. one word. one sentence.

I’m getting the feeling that you’re … apprehensive? thinking? you did say you needed more time to think about us last thursday night. you said a huge chunk of your feelings for me had faded.

but then u were also like "no don’t leave" and "i missed looking at you" and "when you hug me i feel so comforted."

yeah i’m a little confused right now. and a little hurt. and a little worried. and really, really sorry.

i can be very selfish. my ego can get very large. that’s something i want to—have to—work on. so i’m sorry, Anna, for letting my fat ego get in the way of us. i’m sorry for not prioritizing you when you’re my fucking girlfriend, my person. as much as work is important, i don’t think anything’s worth it unless you’re by my side.

and yes, i mean that. i mean that i want you. i mean that i love you. i mean that you’re my person and i want to choose you every single day.

why?

to be honest, i don’t have a good answer to that. i don’t think love is akin to a logic puzzle you can "solve." i think love is simply an action. love is a choice. and i want to choose you.

i don’t want you to feel obligated in any way to love me just because i love you. if after this weekend, after taking some time and really thinking about us, you realize you don’t love me anymore, that’s okay. i’ll be hurt, but that’s okay.

it’ll be okay.
