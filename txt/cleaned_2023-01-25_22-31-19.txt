it's been a bit more than two weeks now

two weeks since we met in person for the first time

can you believe that? i honestly can't

i can't count the number of times i've told our story to my friends

and every time i am always so surprised to say

"yes, it's only been so long"

who are you and why did you come into my life?

so suddenly, so beautifully

so right
