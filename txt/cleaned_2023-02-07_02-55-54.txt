we worked out together for the first time this past weekend

and we both felt it. you told me afterwards and i couldn’t be more surprised about how i’d thought the same thing. about how right it felt to just run alongside you, and how i thought “i could this forever with her”

after we both ran a mile, you did your thing and i did mine. we said hi to each other a few times in between sets and i couldn’t stop glancing at you, so proud of the progress you’ve made so far, and how excited i am for you to keep progressing

after our workout, we chilled in the hot tub for a bit, dipped into the cold plunge until i couldn’t take it anymore (lol), and got disappointed when we found out the sauna on the roof deck was closed for some reason

we got magnolia bakery afterwards and then ate a lively dinner at skirt steak after that (from which we both got zooted from the wine)

i swear, every weekend is an adventure with you, and while i’m sure the objective “newness” of experiences together will dial down over time, ebb and flow as they do in any relationship, i have a feeling things will always feel electric with you in some way, in some sense

because you are the love of my life after all :)
