we spent almost the entire weeekend together, anna.

i- i honestly don't know what to say.

i don't think i've felt my heart this full and this warm in a long, long time, if ever.

every moment with you felt right. every moment felt magical.

we ate delicious food, sang our hearts out, watched arcane (an amazing show), had earth-shattering sex (three times), and grew ever closer to each other.

you taught me how to play league and we 1v1'd each other in val and we went to a cat cafe and placed eggs on top of the kitties' heads and ordered boba right next door and mostly just talked and cuddled and held each other as tight as we could.

you start classes today. i wonder how things will progress between us now that you'll be preoccupied with school. i know we'll both make time for each other so i'm not very worried. more just curious.

as much as i loved spending the weekend with you, i do feel a little bad that i didn't really spend any time producing. although i did practice guitar and singing a little, it definitely wasn't enough to satisfy myself. i'll give myself a pass for this weekend, though, since it was a special one for you and i, a necessary one, even, for us to grow closer together.
