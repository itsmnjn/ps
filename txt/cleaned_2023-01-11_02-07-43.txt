2 hours and 17 minutes flew by just like that

she called me cute :)

i don't know how to feel rn

it's honestly such a mix

of apprehension

delight

joy

and the beginnings of a flame

embers

her voice

her smile

it's that warm fuzzy feeling slowly rising upwards from my stomach into my heart

it's been so long since i've felt something like this, inklings of ...

i don't want to say it just yet

it's too early

or is it?

she must've felt it too right?

she made it a point to say that she feels really comfortable talking to me

she was nervous at first and told me

likened it to a job interview 

haha

i tried writing some songs about it, just some ideas

but i think i'm too fucking choked up rn to properly express these feelings

it's like a glitter bomb has been thrown into the office space of my heart

and now half the little office workers are scrambling to clean it up

but half aren't cleaning and they're just basking in the glitter âœ¨ cuz they love it

it glows and it's beautiful and oh my god her smile

i felt it

that feeling

when you see someone smile and you can't help but say to yourself

"oh my god"

i had a good feeling about her coming into the call and im so glad i was right

for now at least haha

im trying to find songs to listen to that hit

BUT NOTHING'S HITTING

no song expresses this weird nice feeling im feeling

this mix of

yeah she's cool let's see where it goes

and

oh my god she's beautiful both inside and out

and

what are the fucking chances we met

and

this is it isn't it this is what i was looking for this feeling

and

and 

and
