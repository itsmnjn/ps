she's beautiful

makes me feel soft

and warm

and safe

comforted

but also

nervous

in the best possible way

a slight flutter

a little jolt

my heartstrings sing as they are plucked so gently by her soft fingers

last night was

something else

something out of a movie

or kdrama

but honestly it was too like drama free and honest and genuine for it to be in a kdrama lol

we cuddled at night and fell asleep in each other's arms and woke up in the same soft warm embrace
