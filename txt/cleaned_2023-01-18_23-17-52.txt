you asked what i'd prefer you to call me today

i was a little confused since i never really mentioned wanting to be called anything other than "eric"

so i thought this was you discretely asking whether or not i want you to call me your boyfriend (and you my girlfriend)

things are obviously couple-y betw us (hell i even said "we're gonna be that couple") earlier today and you didn't object to that word being used.

but we have yet to "officially" label things.

i wonder if it's getting to you as much as it's getting to me. maybe you don't care about labels so much. maybe it's so obvious to you that it doesn't need to be said. or maybe you feel like i do right now, that it'd be nice to tie things up in a nice, bf/gf type of bow.
