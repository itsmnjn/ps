i'm shuffling through my spotify (and yours) trying so desperately to find a song (the song) that encapsulates how im feeling

i want it to be chill yet tense with that shaky anticipation of a love that hasn't been felt in so long

i'm hesitant yet hopeful

i'm not afraid, but i'm cautious

feelings are feelings after all, whatever that means

but i can't deny them

i can't dent how that one call, that one fucking call made me feel

dizzy

in the best possible way

it's been two days since and you've been nonstop running laps around my head

you pop up in the randomest times and i swipe you away but you keep coming back

or maybe it's because i keep stalking your instagram

i'm so glad you have a bunch of selfies because i never want to forget your face now

or your voice, but that's starting to fade, i've only heard it once after all

of course i want to hear you again, of course i want to call

but i have to leave space for us

i have to

i'm a reasonable person after all and reasonable people take their time with these things, right

i've already started writing a song about you

about how i feel about you

it's cheesy af but i think it has a decent melody and it's not using a typical chord progression which i like

it's near impossible to find music i genuinely LOVE these days, my taste has gone wayyy too far up my own arse

i often think that only i can make music i like anymore lol (please don't take that seriously, i desperately need to humble myself)

and now i don't know why i'm writing as if i'm writing to you

i guess a large part of me is hopeful, expecting even, to show you this (and the many other notes i've written) sometime in the future

hopefully soon

hopefully you feel somewhat the same way, anna
