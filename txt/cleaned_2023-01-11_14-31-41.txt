it’s so fascinating how someone can just come into your life and completely change how you … see everything

well, not to that extent, but just, lift your mood, make you appreciate life more, just how quickly things can change for the absolute better

the best part is that there’s no attachment to this feeling

i’d be completely fine if we were to never speak again

well, not completely, but i wouldn’t be devastated

i would cherish that moment for what it was

obviously i want to see her again

obviously i want to see where this leads

but i’m fine if nothing happens

because those moments with her were fabulous enough

an entire album could come out of those moments

pure bliss
