it is now 1248 am on the friday of our second (in-person) date

isn't that crazy? we've only seen each other face to face once so far. and yet ...

you texted me this morning that you want to "tell me something tomorrow" and my heart lurched out of my chest.

those words have a dark meaning to me for some reason, i don't know why.

but you promised me that it wasn't anything bad, and the way you were texting me seemed to indicate that we were still gucci so ... i calmed down, and began looking forward to tomorrow even more.

i am so, so excited to see you again, anna. you have no idea how much i want to look into your eyes again, see your smile, laugh with you and listen to you.

i want to text you something cheesy af right now but i also want to hold back a little. for some reason. i feel like doing so will make tomorrow all the more sweeter haha.
