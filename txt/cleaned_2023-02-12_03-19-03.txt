you were really honest with me today

about how you were uncomfortable with me going to see chey when i visit home

and i appreciated it so much

i never want to do anything that makes you feel even the slightest bit uncomfortable

thank you for always being open about your feelings

i promise to do the same

this is why i’m so confident in us, anna

we can talk about things, even if we’re scared to

so thank you, anna, for talking to me
