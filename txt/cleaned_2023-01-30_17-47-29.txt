i see the world differently now that you're by my side

i can't quite explain yet what that difference is but it's ...

something about the reassurance of someone always being there to share the ups and the downs

the moments of light and darkness

now that you're here, beside me, the world is more colorful

lights shine brighter

your love warms me in the coldest of storms

your eyes bring me peace when i'm most anxious

your touch caresses my heart in the most intimate of ways

i love you so much, anna
