we took mdma together this past weekend

i remember when i first took it, i couldn’t help but think whether i would ever experience this with someone i truly love

as beautiful as my first ever experience was, i knew it’d be nothing compared to what i might experience with someone else

and that someone else became you this past friday night

you said it yourself later that weekend that it almost felt like we spiritually bonded that night

how i felt looking into your eyes … i don’t think i’ve ever felt anything even remotely close before

just wave after wave of intense love, your face glowing from the soft string lights above

and how it felt to hold you, kiss you, make love to you
