i haven't written you a note in a while now

the past couple weeks have been confusingly hectic

i say confusing because nothing that crazy happened

i guess my sleep schedule and diet just got out of wack for like the 69th time lol

but throughout it all you were there with me and i was there with you

my love for you only grows as the days pass by, to the point where i am surprised, every day, by just how much more i love you

it's a love that's not just felt, but acted upon, as it should be, as love is a choice, and love is an act

you say such sweet words to me every day, and i try and do the same, but man, you're getting good at surprising me

at the randomest times you'll slip in a "i'm so grateful for you" and a "i love you so much" and my heart does a little leap

i hope your heart leaps a little too, whenever i say the same
