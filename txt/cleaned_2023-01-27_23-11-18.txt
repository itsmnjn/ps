you opened up quite a bit to me over text today

you asked to let you know if you're ever overbearing, that you don't want to be too much

you said you tend to give a lot, and that in your previous relationship you fell and no one was there to catch you

it took me a while to reply as i didn't want to come across as prescriptive or uncaring

because i want to be anything but

i eventually responded saying i greatly appreciate your affection and always want to wake up grateful to be by your side

you said that reassured you
