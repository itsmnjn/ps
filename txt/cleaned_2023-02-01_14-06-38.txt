you opened up a lot to me yesterday

it seems like every time we're together we open up to each other evermore

you told me that sometimes when you're bored you'll look at pictures of me and us and i told you i do the same

you told me that sometimes you wonder why i like you

you asked me why i like you

i don't know how i said what i said, but i can say it poured out from the bottom of my heart

i think it takes me a while for my feelings to become "articulatable" but when they do they  flow like rivers

i could tell from the way your eyes lit up and how you almost had to stop yourself from turning away that you were touched, though that might've been an understatement

later that night in your room you told me "i have so many feelings for you"

i replied that i feel the same and you asked "really?" as you always do and i replied "really" as i always do

i then said some more words to you, words that again just flowed oh so gently from my heart, words that expressed how i became so enamored by you and why you had no reason to worry about anything about being overbearing or too much or being a nuisance. 

because i love you for the person you are.
