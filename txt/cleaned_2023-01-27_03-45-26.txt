we had our first impromptu date today

impromptu being defined as having scheduled within the hour of meeting up

u were in ur javascript class and i was procrastinating on work

u asked me what u should eat for dinner and i said “me” hehe

u replied back “:OOOO”

u then asked me if i ate yet and that was all the signal i needed to go for the impromptu date

so i was like “i’d be down for an impromptu dinner date if u are 👉👈”

and u were like “yess”

so we met up outside ur class (it ended early lol) and subway-ed to k-town and ate at kunjip and got grace street for dessert and it was all so amazing so magical so fun and funny to be with you around you next to you across from you holding you holding your hand walking by your side in the freezing cold

it was also the first time i saw ur place, ur apartment in stuytown, and ur room which u said was messy af but it really wasn’t lmao it was really nice

i showed u old pictures and vids of me and u did the same but mostly of the concerts and raves u went to and i showed u my early soundcloud stuff and and and

i couldn’t believe just how much better it got and how much better it keeps getting

with you
