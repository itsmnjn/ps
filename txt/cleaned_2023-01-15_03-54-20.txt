we scheduled our first in-person date today

your favorite curry katsu at suki in st marks

i swear my heart did more backflips than it ever did in its life when u texted me: "My favorite food is you"

i think we called each other cute like 200 times

i'm still in awe with you

in awe with just how quickly you made me fall for you

in awe with just how well we get along when it's been less than week since we even knew of each other's existence

-

you made me a website, the first thing you made for me

i sent you a snippet of a song i'm working on about you

you said it was the first time anyone ever wrote a song for you

i haven't even showed you the other song yet

though i think the one i sent you is better haha
