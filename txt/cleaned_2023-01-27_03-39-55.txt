i asked you to be my girlfriend today

it happened so smoothly, so naturally, i was shocked

a little bit because i thought it was already assumed, or at least the nature of our relationship was definitely felt by both of us, but you did mention today that you really appreciate the gesture of the guy asking

it happened as we were talking about how you like being choked lmao

and how you like it when i choke you

and i mentioned how i think i do it the “right way” aka not actually choking you, just pretending to (as one should!)

and then you joked about how i would react if u ended up dying lmao (kinda morbid)

and then you mentioned how i might go on twitter and be all like “this girl i was seeing just bla bla bla”

and then i thought it was curious how you said “girl i was seeing…”

so i repeated it back to you but instead said “my girlfriend just … bla bla bla”

and then u did that cute little chin tuck of urs, laughed a little bit, then said “but you didn’t even ask me yet”

and i replied “oh i thought it was assumed”

and you shook your head

and so i said “then … do you want to be my girlfriend?”

and you said “do you really mean it?”

“yes yes 100%” i said

then you paused for a while, what seemed like a long while, then said “ok” in like the quietest voice ever lmao i could barely hear it

and then my heart exploded
