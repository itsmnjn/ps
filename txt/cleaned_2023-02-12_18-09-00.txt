dear anna,

five weeks ago we matched, and my life has never been the same since.

when i look at you, i feel warm.

and when i hold you, i feel so, so lucky.

thank you for existing. thank you for coming into my life so gracefully.

i wish to spend the rest of my days alive with you.

laughing, eating bussin food, and raising felix and yuzu.

i love you.

a lot.

a lot.

eric.
